                    RECEIVING IMAGES FROM WEATHER SATELLITES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">RTL-SDR</a>, a USB device that receives radio waves, I
                    was able to receive and decode signals sent from the NOAA
                    and METEOR weather satellites and produce images. I had to
                    build a special antenna specifically tuned to the
                    satellites' frequencies. After doing everything manually, I
                    moved to automating the process. I wrote my own software to
                    record and decode the satellites as they passed overhead,
                    then post them on my website. I also made an app to decode
                    images on my phone.

                <p>
                    I built this website completely from scratch, meaning I
                    wrote almost every line of code. It started a while ago when
                    I purchased the <a href="https://felixperron.ca">felixperron.ca</a> domain name when I saw a
                    cheap deal online. I didn't really have a use for it yet,
                    but I hoped to use it to display what I had accomplished
                    online. Now, not only is it serving its purpose, but I have
                    learned many things making it. It can also be incorporated
                    into my other projects to add a web aspect to them, like I
                    did with my automated satellite receiving project.

                <p>
                    Using a 5v relay, I am able to control my desk lamp form my
                    raspberry pi. This allowed me to control my light depending
                    on some sensors and triggers. I connected a movement sensor
                    to my raspberry pi, so it can automatically toggle my light
                    depending on if there is movement in my room. Using python
                    and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">flask</a>, I setup a server which allows me to control my
                    light by sending it a command via the internet. This allows
                    me to toggle my light from my phone, or from google
                    assistant.
